 Project 2: Manual Testing – Sauce Labs (User Authentication)

📅 Duration: Dec 2024 – Jan 2025
🔧 Tools Used: Sauce Labs Live Testing Environment, Excel (Test Scenarios), Manual Testing Techniques
🔍 Type: Functional Manual Testing

📄 Project Overview

This project focused on validating the user authentication module of the Sauce Labs application using manual testing techniques. The primary aim was to test how securely and reliably users are authenticated under various input scenarios and sessions.

✅ Key Responsibilities

Designed and executed manual test cases for Registration, Login, and Logout workflows.

Conducted positive testing (valid inputs) and negative testing (invalid data, blank fields, SQL injections) to assess robustness.

Verified the session handling mechanism to ensure proper state retention and logout behavior across browsers and tabs.

Tested for edge cases, such as account lockout after multiple failed attempts and validation error messages.


🔍 Test Coverage

Input Validations: Email formats, password length, special character handling.

Error Handling: Message prompts for invalid/blank fields, forgotten password links.

Session Management: Secure logout, multi-tab behavior, re-login scenarios.


💡 Learning Outcome

Gained practical experience in security and reliability testing for user login modules.

Understood importance of boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning.

Learned how to structure test documentation for user-centric features with real-world relevance.
